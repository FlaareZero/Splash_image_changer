# Splash Image Changer
A simple python script that automatically grabs a logo.img with given bmp files, repacks it with those in and lets you customize those fastboot and boot splash images :)
Original idea and concept + offsets written by pivcer@xda-developers for the Xiaomi Mi9SE (which the script was written to work with)
