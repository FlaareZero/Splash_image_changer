# Splash Image Changer
A simple python script that automatically grabs a logo.img with given bmp files, repacks it with those in and lets you customize those fastboot and boot splash images.

Original idea and concept + offsets written by pivcer@xda-developers for the Xiaomi Mi9SE (which the script was written to work with)

#How it works
Place the .bmp's on the same folder as your script with the /logo partition in img format, by making sure to edit the offsets as per your device's logo partition if supported, then execute the script and flash the given logo.img on your device to check if it actually worked
